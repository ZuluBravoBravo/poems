        body: `Forgiveness is the fragrance\nThe violet sheds on the heel\nThat has crushed it.\n\nForgiveness is a quiet thing,\nA medicine we carry inside,\nTo heal the wounds that won't stop bleeding.\n\nIt is the letting go of weight,\nThe opening of hands that once clenched\nTo hold resentment's heavy stone.\n\nForgiveness is not forgetting,\nBut freeing ourselves from the chains\nThat bind us to the past.`,
